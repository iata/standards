# IATA Offers & Orders Standards – Example XML Messages

This repository provides **example XML messages for the IATA Enhanced & Simplified Distribution standards**.

The goal of this repository is to support implementers by providing **realistic, end-to-end XML message examples** that complement the official Implementation Guide for Offers & Orders.

These examples illustrate complete message flows and practical usage patterns as represented in the Worked Examples chapter of the [EASD Implementation Guide](https://standards.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EASD/pages/574586985).
